<div class=js-about id=#about><p><span class=italic>The Still, Small Voice</span> is a melodic indie-rock band based out of Nashville, TN. Originating as the solo-project of Christiana Benton, two albums were released in previous years: <span class=italic>In Tension</span> (2013) and <span class=italic>Mourning Dove EP</span> (2014). Both were produced and pressed through the generosity of friends, family, and strangers, and as way to say “thank-you” it was decided they would be given as free gifts to anyone who wanted them.</p><p>From the beginning, the plan was for TSSV to be a full band. Eventually, members began coming out of the woodwork, and at the very initial practice, in a dimly-lit basement, it was evident something had clicked. It felt like a band, but it also felt like a family.</p><p>2015 holds a lot of potential as the band embarks on tours while also polishing songs toward a new album. The overall motive of <span class=italic>The Still, Small Voice</span> is to share honest moments set to music that create an atmosphere of connectedness and meaning.</p></div>
