Originating as the solo-project of Christiana Benton, two albums were released in the last two years, In Tension (2013) and Mourning Dove EP (2014). Both albums were produced and pressed through the generosity of friends, family, and strangers, and as way to say “thank-you” she decided they would be given as gifts to anyone who wanted them, regardless of how much money they had.</p><p>From the beginning, the intention was for TSSV to be a full band, but finding the right members took time. Chris Vicari was a friend and drummer who had played drums on In Tension. He told Christiana he would be there when it came time to form an official band and tour. It took two years, but he finally got to live up to his promise. They quickly recruited the help of Harrison Peaks to play keys and Alex Macwilliam to play bass, both of whom had been long-time friends. At the very first practice, in a very narrow, dimly-lit basement, it was evident that something had clicked. It felt like a band, but it also felt like a little family. Their first show in Grand Rapids, Michigan only confirmed they had found the right fit within themselves.</p><p>2015 holds a lot of potential as the band embarks on a small tour through the northeast come this February. In the mean time, songs are being written and polished toward a new album and shows are being played in and around Nashville. All in all, their goal is to create a sense of connectedness and community among hearers. They do this with raw honesty that also happens to be set against a backdrop of pretty sounds.</p></div><div class=js-blog id=#blog><script src=http://the-still-small-voice.tumblr.com/js type=text/javascript></script></div><div class=js-contact id=#contact><p>For booking and general inquiry, email us at: <a href=mailto:thestillsmallvoicemail@gmail.com>thestillsmallvoicemail@gmail.com</a></p></div><div class=js-tour id=#tour><table><thead><th></th><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tuesday, 2/24></td><td>Louisville, KY</td><td>The Sanctuary</td></tr><tr><td>Wednesday, 2/25></td><td>Grand Rapids, MI</td><td>Take Hold Church</td></tr><tr><td>Thursday, 2/26></td><td>Dewitt, MI</td><td>The Draft House</td></tr><tr><td>Friday, 2/27></td><td>Wilmington, OH</td><td>Joe's Java</td></tr><tr><td>Sunday, 3/1></td><td>Waterloo, ON</td><td>Lifespring Christian Fellowship</td></tr><tr><td>Monday, 3/2></td><td>Buffalo, NY</td><td>The Well</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesday, 3/3></td><td>Buffalo, NY</td><td>Mohawk Place</td></tr><tr><td>Wednesday, 3/4></td><td>Rochester, NY</td><td>The Pillar</td></tr><tr><td>Saturday, 3/7></td><td>Flemington, NJ</td><td>Fuel Coffee Co.</td></tr><tr><td>Sunday, 3/8</td><td>Clinton, NJ</td><td>The Hub</td></tr><tr><td>Monday, 3/9</td><td>Catonsville, MD</td><td>Shepherd Space</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><footer id=footer-primary class=footer-primary></footer><script src=http://pocketbird.github.io/tssv/scripts/1680.app.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
